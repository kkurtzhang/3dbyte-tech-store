## Morning Standup

### Build Fix Completed
- **Issue:** Storefront build failed when CMS (192.168.0.45:1337) unreachable
- **Root Cause:** CMS-dependent pages using static generation with `revalidate = 3600`
- **Solution:** Added `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'` to force runtime rendering
- **Files Fixed:**
  - `/app/page.tsx` (home)
  - `/app/about/page.tsx`
  - `/app/faq/page.tsx`
  - `/app/blog/page.tsx`
- **Also:** Removed duplicate `/app/about-us/page.tsx` (redirect in next.config.js)

### Build Verification
```
✓ Compiled successfully in 5.3s
✓ Generating static pages (36/36)
Process exited with code: 0
```

### Sprint Status
- **Completed:** 98 tasks
- **Remaining:** 2 content tasks (require CMS admin access)
  - Docs page content (TDS, SDS resources)
  - Product rich_description fields

### Services
- All services down (expected - no active sub-agents)
- Build passes with fallback content

### Next Steps
- CMS content entry when ready
- No code tasks pending for @Merchant or @Pixel
