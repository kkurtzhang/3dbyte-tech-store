## Conversation Summary

assistant: The alias exists. Let me check if we need to explicitly add the fallback model to the config:

assistant: The model alias is already configured. Let me try spawning a task with the correct syntax:

assistant: **Issue found:** Model "not allowed" - need to add to agent's allowed models. Let me check and update:

assistant: The model is in fallbacks but not explicitly allowed. Let me try using the alias "GLM-2" instead:

assistant: Let me try a different approach - spawn with the plain model and let fallback work:

assistant: **✅ `zai/glm-4.7` works!** The issue is the `#zai:fallback2` syntax. The fallback chain is configured at the gateway level and works automatically when using the base model.

Let me retry Search Autocomplete with the correct model:

assistant: Let me update the task board:

assistant: **✅ Fixed! Model alias issue resolved.**

**Issue:** The `#zai:fallback2` syntax isn't supported in spawn commands
**Solution:** Use plain `zai/glm-4.7` - the gateway's fallback chain handles auth profiles automatically

**Actions taken:**
- Retried Search Autocomplete with `zai/glm-4.7` (modelApplied: ✅)
- Updated TASK_BOARD.md - Product Compare moved to COMPLETED
- Search Autocomplete now on retry 2/2

**Current tasks:**
- ✅ Product Compare - COMPLETED
- 🔄 Search Autocomplete - retrying (zai/glm-4.7)
- 🔄 Wishlist Page UI - active
- 🔄 PDF Invoice - active
- 🔄 Address Book UI - active

Findings:
ALIAS WORKS

Stats: runtime 9s • tokens 17.2k (in 317 / out 239) • sessionKey agent:architect:subagent:eab46c65-9bb5-47a9-b01c-6d5aa30758c4 • sessionId 2ef42af7-23ba-4438-aeda-60f6ca185c6d • transcript /Users/3dbyte-tech/.openclaw/agents/architect/sessions/2ef42af7-23ba-4438-aeda-60f6ca185c6d.jsonl

Summarize this naturally for the user. Keep it brief (1-2 sentences). Flow it into the conversation naturally.
Do not mention technical details like tokens, stats, or that this was a subagent task.
You can respond with NO_REPLY if no announcement is needed (e.g., internal task with no user-facing result).
assistant: **Alias Works!** The `zai/glm-4.7#zai:fallback2` model alias is actually functional (just shows a warning). 

Good to know - the fallback chain is working. We're retrying Search Autocomplete now with the confirmed-working `zai/glm-4.7` model.

assistant: **GLM-2 Alias Also Works!** Both alias formats confirmed working:

- ✅ `zai/glm-4.7#zai:fallback2`
- ✅ `GLM-2`

The model fallback system is fully functional. Search Autocomplete retry should be in progress now.

assistant: **All Models Working!** All three test formats confirmed:

- ✅ `zai/glm-4.7#zai:fallback2` → ALIAS WORKS
- ✅ `GLM-2` → GLM2 ALIAS WORKS  
- ✅ `zai/glm-4.7` → ZAI DIRECT WORKS

The entire model stack is operational. Progress is good!
user: Pre-compaction memory flush. Store durable memories now (use memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md; create memory/ if needed). If nothing to store, reply with NO_REPLY.
