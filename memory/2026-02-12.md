# Feb 12, 2026 - Sub-Agent System Enablement

## Key Changes

### Sub-Agent Spawning Fixed
- Issue: `agents_list` returned empty allowlist (only `architect` configured)
- Solution: Set `allowAny: true` in architect's config via `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`

### HEARTBEAT.md Updates
- **Concurrency Limit:** Max 2 sub-agents running simultaneously
- **Architect Authority:** Can investigate & fix blockers, assign tasks simultaneously
- **Low Backlog Rule:** When BACKLOG < 3 tasks, Architect MUST investigate project
- **Investigation Methods:** playwright-cli browse, code scan, git exploration

### Sub-Agent Workspace Configuration
- Sub-agents run in isolated sandboxes
- `--workdir` flag doesn't grant filesystem access
- **Solution:** Include `cd /absolute/path` as first command in task
