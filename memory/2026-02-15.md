## CMS Work Completed

### Team Component Created
- Created "Team" component in Strapi CMS (About-us category)
- Fields: `name` (Short text), `role` (Short text), `bio` (Long text), `image` (Single media)
- Added as repeatable field to About-Us content type
- All changes saved (Strapi restarted)

### About Page Dynamic Updates
- `/about` page now fetches content from CMS
- Banner image from CMS
- Timeline from CMS (year, title, description)
- Team from CMS (name, role, bio, image)
- Values section remains static

### Code Changes
- `types.ts`: Added TimelineItem and TeamMember interfaces
- `content.ts`: Updated getAboutUs() to populate Timeline and Team
- `about/page.tsx`: Made async, fetches CMS data

## Build Fixes
1. community/page.tsx: Replaced invalid "Discord" icon with MessageCircle
2. products/[handle]/page.tsx: Fixed null handling for rich_description (added `?? undefined`)

## Commits
- `d667e19`: feat: make /about page dynamic with CMS content
- `9afe9d0`: docs: update task board
- `71fd65b`: fix: replace Discord icon with MessageCircle
- `219ad41`: fix: handle null rich_description

## Remaining Tasks (Manual CMS Content)
1. ~~Upload 3D printing banner image to About-Us~~ ✅ Done (LulzBot TAZ 6 image)
2. ~~Add Timeline entries (year, title, description)~~ ✅ Done via API
3. ~~Add Team members (name, role, bio)~~ ✅ Done via API (no images yet)
4. Docs page: 3D printing content (TDS, SDS)

## Note
- Strapi CMS UI very buggy via playwright-cli
- Used REST API for reliable content updates
- Team member images can be added later

## Key Files
- CMS: `http://192.168.0.45:1337/admin`
- Types: `apps/storefront-v3/src/lib/strapi/types.ts`
- Content: `apps/storefront-v3/src/lib/strapi/content.ts`
- About page: `apps/storefront-v3/src/app/about/page.tsx`

## Notes
- playwright-cli works better than browser tool for Strapi CMS interactions
- CMS admin credentials available in context
