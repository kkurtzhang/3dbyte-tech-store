# 2026-02-10 - Project Initialization & Infrastructure

## Infrastructure & Configuration
- Verified database connectivity:
  - Backend (Medusa v2): PostgreSQL `192.168.0.137`
  - CMS (Strapi v5): PostgreSQL `192.168.0.137`
  - Storefront (Next.js 16): Backend API `192.168.0.45:9000`
- Updated cron jobs (Morning-Standup, Architect-Hourly-Drive, Evening-Review) to announce to Telegram.
- Configured cron schedule to user's Hobart timezone (AEDT):
  - Morning Standup: `30 11 * * *` (11:30 AM PST -> 6:30 AM AEDT next day)
  - Evening Review: `0 23 * * *` (11:00 PM PST -> 6:00 PM AEDT same day)

## Development Status
- **Backend:** 
  - Fixed `medusa-config.ts` by removing broken `@lodashventure/medusa-media-manager` dependency.
  - Verified Meilisearch and Stripe config pending.
- **Storefront:**
  - Fixed inline "use server" build error in `account-content.tsx` by extracting to `actions/account.ts`.
  - Updated environment variables for backend connection.
- **QA:**
  - Fixed `pnpm test` failure in `shared-utils` by adding a dummy test.
  - Full monorepo builds are passing.

## Incidents
- **Server Crash:** User reported OpenClaw server (macOS VM) crashed twice.
  - Findings: Memory pressure detected (4GB+ Node process). Hard crash (Shutdown Cause: -128).
  - Suspicion: `pnpm-helper` (likely JetBrains/IDE tool) or high-concurrency builds exhausting VM RAM.

## User Preferences
- Timezone: Australia/Hobart (AEDT).
- Communication: Telegram for all announcements.
- Philosophy: "DB is external, verifying connection is enough" (No local migrations unless necessary).
