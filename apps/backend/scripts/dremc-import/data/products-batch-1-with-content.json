      "original_description": "CNC Kitchen Threaded Inserts by CNC Kitchen are a comprehensive metric threaded insert set designed for FDM 3D printed parts. This kit includes sizes ranging from M1.6 to M10, with both metric and imperial 1.4\" options, providing durable and reusable screw threads for your 3D printing projects. The inserts are engineered with a knurled exterior for secure bonding to plastic materials like PLA, PETG, and ABS. Installation is straightforward using a soldering iron set to the filament printing temperature plus 10°C, allowing the plastic to melt around the insert and create a mechanical lock. These heat-set inserts prevent thread wear during repeated assembly and disassembly, making them ideal for functional parts that require regular maintenance or modification."
