      "body_html": "<p>All features of the T-Volcano nozzle are similar to those of the Volcano. The T-Volcano model is a perfect replacement for the Volcano nozzle. Its thread is M6. Can support PT100 Volcano BLOCK. And support all series products. The nozzle has a higher artistic value. And more advanced manufacturing processes. I hope my customers can like it.</p>\n<h3>Product Include:</h3>\n<div>\n<ul>\n<li>1x Trianglelab Plated Copper T- Volcano Compatible Nozzle</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<h3>Supported Hotends:<br>\n</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Artillery Sidewinder X1</li>\n<li>E3D Volcano HotEnd 1.75mm Filament</li>\n<li>Tevo Little Monster</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Manufacturer Information: </h3>\n<ul>\n<li>All nozzles are manufactured by German equipment through a number of complex processes.All of our nozzles have a separate model body. Each model requires drilling on the corresponding model body. The nozzles of other companies are uniform blank bodies that are then drilled directly by drill bits of different bore sizes. Doing so can result in incorrect nozzle specifications and very large errors in accuracy, which can seriously affect the performance of the printer. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>*Durable, non-stick, high temperature performance nozzles. This copper alloy is very temperature resilient, and will not start to soften or anneal until way beyond 500°C, making it perfect for the high-temperature 3D printing that other nozzles can't handle. These nozzles are fully integrated into the Volcano hotend, DDB extruder Hotend and are compatible with Prusa 3D printers</p>\n<ul>\n<li>These nozzles are engineered for ultimate high temperature performance. Made from a special high temperature copper-alloy with a softening point of well above 500°C, and with much-increased thermal conductivity these copper nozzles are perfect for high temperature applications, while working perfectly with everyday filaments like PLA, ABS and spoolWorks EDGE.In addition to high temperature performance these nozzles have an advanced nickel based plating, considerably reducing the adhesion of plastic to the nozzle. This is great for everyday filaments keeping things clean and shiny, but is particularly important at temperatures above 300°C where a silicone sock can't be used.</li>\n<li>Copper has more than 3x the thermal conductivity of brass, and the copper alloy we use has been hardened and treated to reduce the oxidation that occurs in copper at high temperatures. The higher thermal conductivity will also slightly increase your heat-up times, and can provide tighter temperature control.</li>\n<li>This copper-alloy is very temperature resilient, and will not start to soften or anneal until way beyond 500°C, making it perfect for the high-temperature printing that other nozzles can't handle.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><br><br></p>\n<div><br></div>",

Rated to a max temperature of 300°C.</p>\n<h4>ObXidian </h4>\n<p>ObXidian offers wear resistance far exceeding that of any other E3D nozzle, making it exceptionally durable. It is significantly harder than Nozzle X and all standard hardened steel nozzles. This superior hardness comes from combining a tool steel insert with our advanced E3DLC™ coating. Additionally, this unique coating provides built-in non-stick properties, greatly reducing plastic buildup on the nozzle.</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<h3>Documentation: </h3>\n<p><strong> Please note: </strong></p>\n<p>Volcano nozzles are not compatible with the V6, SuperVolcano or Cyclops heater blocks.</p>\n<p>E3D nozzles are identifiable with markings on the flats of the hex head, please see the table below for identification.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0259/1948/8059/files/Volcano_Nozzle_Dot_Chart_V2.png?v=1590506537\" alt=\"\"></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</section>\n</div>\n</section>",

Developed in partnership with Bambu Lab, these ObXidian High Flow HotEnds deliver a compact, lightweight design coupled with exceptional performance. DREMC is an authorised E3D reseller, ensuring genuine quality and support.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>High Flow.</strong> There's no denying that the Bambu Lab X1 and P1 series printers are built for speed. However, the motion system, as remarkable as it is, has headroom to be even better. That's where E3D High Flow technology comes in. Using our internal nozzle modification, we've managed to increase the volumetric flow rate of the HotEnd by 60%! That means you can expect more reliable and consistent extrusion at the same speeds or bump up the volumetric flow rate limit in the slicer to utilise the motion systems' capabilities fully.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Smooth and Hard.</strong> We've applied our E3DLC™ coating to the nozzle and heater parts, adding even more abrasive resistance for all your fibre-filled fun and a non-stick protective layer to prevent plastic build-up on the Nozzle.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>No compromise.</strong> All of these new additions come in the same form factor as your stock Bambu; simply reuse your temperature sensor and heater pads, and it drops in place with no adjustment to the mount or part cooling required.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Compatibility.</strong> The E3D High Flow HotEnd is compatible with the X1, X1 Carbon, P1S, and P1P.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a rel=\"noopener\" title=\"Bambu Lab Support: ObXidian High Flow HotEnd\" href=\"https://e3d-online.com/pages/bambu-lab-support-obxidian-high-flow-hotend\" target=\"_blank\">E3D Datasheet</a></p>\n<h3>What is Included:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>1 x Bambu Lab High Flow ObXidian HotEnd 0.40 mm or 0.60mm</li>\n<li>1 x Thermal Grease</li>\n<li>1 x Bambu Lab Sock</li>\n<li>1 x Bambu Lab Heater Retaining Spring</li>\n<li>2 x Bambu Lab Bolts</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Documentation:</h3>\n<p><a title=\"Install An E3D High Flow ObXidian HotEnd On Your Bambu Lab\" href=\"https://support.dremc.com.au/en/support/solutions/articles/51000427574-install-an-e3d-high-flow-obxidian-hotend-on-your-bambu-lab\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://support.dremc.com.au/en/support/solutions/articles/51000427574-install-an-e3d-high-flow-obxidian-hotend-on-your-bambu-lab</a></p>\n<p>Avoid using 0.4mm with Galaxy/Glitter Filament, we found cht channel tend to partial clog over time on materials. </p>",

This edition is designed for Ender 3 V3 KE. <strong>Stock z-height, build volume and firmware remains unchanged.</strong></p>\n<h3>Features:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Leak-Proof Nozzle:<br></strong>Tired of messy nozzle leaks that ruin your prints and waste filament? FlowTech Hotend combines nozzle and thermal break into one permanently sealed assembly that ensures a leak-proof hotend.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Cold Nozzle Change:<br></strong>Swapping out nozzles used to be a time-consuming and potentially hazardous task. With a FlowTech Hotend, nozzle changes are effortless, and there's no need for hot tightening, and you can do it with just one hand.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>High-Flow Characteristics:<br></strong>Ceramic cylindrical heater and 28.6mm melt zone provides excellent volumetric flow rate.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>All-Metal Design:<br></strong>Built to last! FlowTech hotend features an all-metal design that can handle most modern 3D printing filaments.

If you're printing in a enclosure, please ensure open front door or have enough exhaust fan working to lower the ambient chamber temperature to prevent heat creep. <br></span></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"Polaris-Tag_375hg Polaris-Tag--removable_1q527\"><span class=\"Polaris-Tag__TagText_lsfh6\" title=\"Ender 3 S1 Pro\"><strong>What do I need do when after install?</strong> You may need to update or make change to you're printing profile due change nozzle material type and heat break type. This could mean lower/adjustment to retraction and printing temperature and speed. You will also need to perform PID auto tune on the hotend, and precaution we recommend hot tighten the nozzle at &lt;1.5nm. We also recommend adjust your z-off set and re-run wizard/re-level bed or do calibration \"on\".
