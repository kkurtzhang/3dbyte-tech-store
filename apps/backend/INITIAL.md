## FEATURE:

Add Meilisearch Sync Page to Admin Dashboard

## EXAMPLES:

In the `examples/` folder, there is a README for you to read to understand what the example is all about and also how to structure your own README when you create documentation for the above feature.
Read through all of the files here to understand best practices for creating Pydantic AI agents that support different providers and LLMs, handling agent dependencies, and adding tools to the agent.

Don't copy any of these examples directly, it is for a different project entirely. But use this as inspiration and for best practices.
